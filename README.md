* I used Python for data fetching api using ```request``` library and ```Pandas``` for filtering data and exporting it to CSV.
* The most popular languages based on usage are Python,Javascript,C++ and Java . Languages with the highest average stars include BitBake, Coq, and PHP, indicating these languages may host some high-profile repositories despite lower counts. In 2020 there is a hike in repository creation trend. Most commonly used licence is MIT licence
* Focus on Python or JavaScript projects, or high-star languages like PHP or C++ for maintaining the demand in market . Use the MIT license to attract contributors, as itâ€™s widely trusted.
## ðŸšœ Process
  The assignment was to search users who has 50 above followers from Zuchin city. and repositories of these users. There is no direct way to find users with repos. First we need to fetch the users, then repositories of that each users but upto **500 latest repos** . ```request``` library made easy for consuming the API including the parameteres and API KEY.
